  I predict the price(MSRP) of car from features such as the amount of horsepower, miles per gallon in the city and highway, and the weight
of the car. I ended up using a Random Forest Regressor to make my predictions as it gave me a 97% prediction accuracy and a very low mean 
squared error of .023.
