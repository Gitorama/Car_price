I built a predictive model using Random Forest Regression,  that predicted the price(MSRP) of a car from features such as the amount of horsepower, miles per gallon in the city and highway, and the weight
of the car.

Some of the results that surprised me were the fact that Porsches were the most expensive cars on average, that Cadillacs were the most expensive American cars on average, and that the Dodge Viper SRT-10 Convertible had the most horsepower than any other car of close to 500hp.
